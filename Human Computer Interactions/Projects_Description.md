#CS522_Fall2015 - World Urban Development Data Visualization.

##Purpose:

Purpose of the project is to provide a user friendly and interactive visualization of world urban development over the past 5 decades. 

##Brief Description:

Based on the clientâ€™s data set, application aims to provide visual representations in two ways: Single parameter and Two parameter for comparison in the urban development for multiple countries. In single parameter selection, the application provides visualization in the form of small multiples linked by a map for countries selection for given set of dimension/parameter. In two parameter comparison, the application provides facility to a user similar to that of gapminder visualization, but using google motion chart api. It allows user to select two parameters and provides a timeline to user to brush over it to see trend in urban development for multiple countries. The application takes various HCI design concepts into consideration such as Fitt's Law, Tufte Design principles, Small multiples, linking and brushing and etc. 

##List of features:

Map Based Visualization of Urban Data
Motion Charts
