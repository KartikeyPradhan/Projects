#Projects Description

##Content Providers/Resolvers
A small project incorporating the Content providers in Andriod application. The content provider class provides all the 
operations that can be performed in the database, and also manages database, and the content resolver uses these facilities 
to communicate with database, without having actual database in its own application.
Running instruction: Install apk for contentprovider first and then install the apk for contentresolver to successfully run
the application 

##Image Displayer
This is a small application that works as a gallery. As a part of this project, I was required to implement various android concepts: Dynamic Fragments, Grid-Display, Menu Items, use of Asyntask(multi-threading).
